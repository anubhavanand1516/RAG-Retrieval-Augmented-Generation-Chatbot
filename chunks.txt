Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.
These processes include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.
AI is applied in many areas such as machine learning, robotics, natural language processing, and computer vision.
Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has significantly advanced AI research and applications.
Artificial intelligence systems can be divided into narrow AI (task-specific) and general AI (human-level intelligence).
